         Write cancellable async method with timeout handling, that concurrently tries to get data from
         provided urls (first wins and its response is returned, rest is __cancelled__).
         
         Tips:
         * consider using HttpClient.GetAsync (as it is cancellable)
         * consider using Task.WhenAny
         * you may use urls like for testing https://postman-echo.com/delay/3
         * you should have problem with tasks cancellation -
            - how to merge tokens of operations (timeouts) with the provided token? 
            - Tip: you can link tokens with the help of CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(token)
